# ml_practice

Hi! I am razi!
If it isn't obvious already, I am maintaining this repository to practice ml. Deep learning with TensorFlow to be precise.
I upload files almost everyday and hope that I don't procrastinate in doing that.

The code is from various sources but one that I would like to mention is deeplearning.ai's Tensorflow in Practice.
Do note that these are not blindly copied notebooks from the course rather the ones in which I had practiced.
Credit of some of the code goes to Laurence Moroney and deeplearning.ai.

Thank you!
